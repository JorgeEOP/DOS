# DOS
The files in the main folder are global and they need to be modified depending on the specific system and pdos files.
TbPc2 contains the code to produce a file with the following colums:
  1) Energies of the MO
  2) Total density of states for alpha spin
  3) Total density of states for beta spin
  4) Total density of states (i.e. the sum of Alpha and Beta spin DOS)
  Projected density of states per Spin and element 
    5)  Alpha Nitrogen
    6)  Alpha Carbon
    7)  Alpha Tb
    8)  Alpha H
    9)  Beta Nitrogen
    10) Beta Carbon
    11) Beta Tb
    12) Beta H
  13) Projected Alpha spin density of states for the whole system of two ligands
  14) Projected Beta spin density of states for the whole system of two ligands
  15) Projected Alpha spin density of states for the 4f Tb electrons
  16) Projected Beta spin density of states for the 4f Tb electrons
